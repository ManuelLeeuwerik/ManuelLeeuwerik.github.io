If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable() knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
